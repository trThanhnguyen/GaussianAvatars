## Installation

```shell
pip install -e .
```

For face landmark detection, [face-alignment](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment) is the easiest to install while [STAR](https://github.com/ShenhanQian/STAR/) is more precise.

## Run

```shell
SUBJECT="306"

## Troubleshooting

### FFMPEG

```
MovieWriter stderr:
[libopenh264 @ 0x55699c4ce400] Incorrect library version loaded
Error initializing output stream 0:0 -- Error while opening encoder for output stream #0:0 - maybe incorrect parameters such as bit_rate, rate, width or height
```

Solution:

``` shell
# upgrade ffmpeg
conda install ffmpeg
```

### EGL

  ```
  fatal error: EGL/egl.h: No such file or directory
